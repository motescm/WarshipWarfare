This is a game created by Curtis Motes using PyProcessing. To play, be sure to download all of the files and save them into one folder. Also, be sure you have Processing and PyProcessing already installed.

After you've downloaded processing, click Java in the top right corner, click 'Add Mode...' and install Python Mode for processing.

To play, use the WASD keys to move your tank. Press F to fire. The objective of the game is to dodge the missiles of the warship while shooting it with your own missiles. Collect the coins to boost your score. You have 3 lives, and the warship takes 15 hits to be defeated. Thank you for playing!
